INTRODUCTION
-------------------
TMSEEG is a Matlab App designed for streamlined processing of EEG data 
collected during TMS application.  Processing steps are presented using a
GUI format with modularity.  

UPDATES
--------------------
V3.1 - Changes made to plotting functions for compatibility with MATLAB 2016
* V3.1 is not backward compatible past 2014 due to use of dot notation
  for graphical objects.

REQUIREMENTS
--------------------
TMSEEG was built on MATLAB v2013a, with use of EEGLAB v12.0.2.6b.  Both
EEGLAB and MATLAB support backward compatibility with more recent releases.
